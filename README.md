# Hangman
This hangman game replicates the traditional "pen and paper" game, but instead within a python terminal. This game aims to allow users to be able to play games of hangman, independently, against the computer. Players can choose a difficulty (easy, medium, hard) to randomly generate a word from the corresponding list. Users can input an individual letter to guess if the word contains the letter. The user starts the game with six lives; meaning that if six incorrect guesses are provided, they lose the game. The user can win the game by guessing all of the letters in the word. Throughout the game, the user constantly receives feedback, such as updates to the word, remaining lives, input requests etc, to make the game intuitive for the user.

The taret audience for this project would include fans of the traditional hangman game that perhaps want to try a virtual version of the game, or people that have no playing partner so rely on playing individually against a computer. Users can play for fun, but also have the possibility of challenging themselves with the hard difficulty.
